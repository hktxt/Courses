    "# Components of BigGAN\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll learn about and implement the components of BigGAN, the first large-scale GAN architecture proposed in [Large Scale GAN Training for High Fidelity Natural Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.11096) (Brock et al. 2019). BigGAN performs a conditional generation task, so unlike StyleGAN, it conditions on a certain class to generate results. BigGAN is based mainly on empirical results and shows extremely good results when trained on ImageNet and its 1000 classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors propose a several changes that improve state-of-the-art Inception Score (IS) and Frechet Inception Distance (FID), including:\n",
    " - **Increasing batch size by a factor of 8**, which improves IS by 46% and improves FID by 35%, but also induces complete mode collapse in training.\n",
    " - **Increasing the number of convolutional channels by 1.5x**, which improves IS by 21% and FID by 23%.\n",
    " - **Using shared class-conditional embeddings $c$ in BatchNorm layers**, which reduces the number of parameters and increases IS by 2% and FID by 4%.\n",
    " - **Adding skip connections from latent noise $z$** by concatenating chunks of $z$ to $c$. This improves IS by 1% and FID by 5%.\n",

    "## The Truncation Trick and Orthogonal Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "You should already be familiar with the truncation trick, which truncates the range of values of random noise $z$. Truncation to values close to 0 increases fidelity but decreases variety. Truncation to values further from 0 does the opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Truncation results in a different distribution of $z$ values from the one seen in training, which can cause saturation artifacts. The authors address this by making $G$ well-defined, or *smooth*, on the full distribution of $z$ values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, they employ orthogonal regularization, first introduced in [Neural Photo Editing with Introspective Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07093) (Brock et al. 2017). The authors modify this regularization technique for BigGAN and formulate it as\n",

BigGAN augments its residual blocks with these attention blocks.\n",

How important two positions are to each other is measured by dot product as $QK^\\top$, hence **dot product attention**.
